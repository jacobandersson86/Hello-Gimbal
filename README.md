# Hello Gimbal Example
[!Picture of a Gimbal](docs/picture0.jpg)

Reads a xy gimbal and prints out the input in "progress bars" using a 
EPS32 PICO KIT. Can be used in visual studio. See repo 
"[ESP32_VSCODE](https://github.com/jacobandersson86/ESP32_VSCODE)" 
to 
setup visual studio code for this project.

Connect x potentiometer to GPIO32 and y potentiometer to GPIO33. Supply 
with 3V3 (and GND).
